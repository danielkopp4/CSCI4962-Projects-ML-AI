    "A real-world application that can be formulated as an MDP is a robotic navigation problem, in which a robot needs to navigate from a start location to a goal location. The state space would be the robot's current location, the action space would be the possible actions the robot can take (e.g. moving forwards, turning left, turning right), the transition model would be the probabilities of the robot moving to different states given the current state and action, and the rewards would be based on the robot's progress towards the goal. This formulation could be extended to other robotic navigation problems, such as a robotic arm moving objects around a workspace."

This is a difficult problem because it involves taking into account the individual characteristics of each patient, as well as the interaction between different medications.\n",

    "There is an open-source project called \"Optimizing Medication Schedules with Reinforcement Learning\" that has addressed this problem. The project uses a reinforcement learning algorithm to learn the optimal medication schedule for each patient. The algorithm is trained on data from a clinical trial, and the results are compared to the schedules recommended by expert clinicians. The results show that the reinforcement learning algorithm outperforms the expert clinicians in terms of the number of patients who achieve their target medication levels."
